# recovery-images-for-ASUS-Zenfone-8
This repository contains unofficial, self-created recovery images for the **ASUS Zenfone 8**

There is now a GitHub repository with workflows to create **OrangeFox recoveries** for the **ASUS Zenfone 8** (or any other phone) on the GitHub server:

[https://github.com/bnsmb/OrangeFox-Recovery-Builder-2024](https://github.com/bnsmb/OrangeFox-Recovery-Builder-2024)

The workflows in that repository can be used to create **OrangeFox recoveries** for the **ASUS Zenfone 8** on the GitHub servers. 

The repository also contains a workflow to create an **OrangeFox recovery** that can be used to access the **/data** partition if **LineageOS 21** or newer (or a Custom ROM based on **LineageOS**) is installed on the phone.


A GitHub repository with a workflow to create a **TWRP** recovery for the **ASUS Zenfone 8** is also available:

[https://github.com/bnsmb/TWRP-Recovery-Builder-2024](https://github.com/bnsmb/TWRP-Recovery-Builder-2024)

Note that you don't need to install anything locally on your PC to use the Workflows in these GitHub repositories - just fork the GitHub repository and create your own recoveries. For more information, see the documentation in these GitHub repositories.
